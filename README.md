- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Piper - a.k.a. - @spiperman.  I've been involved in designing and engineering IT systems for decades, but moved away from hands on coding years ago. Now that life has settled down a bit, I've decided to learn how to design and build websites and supporing applications.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in furthering my ability to create solid secure web applications using HTML 5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, jQuery, Javascript, MySQL, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my skills on web / database integration, jQuery, and Ajax.  I'll push out to newer technology once I'm better at the basics.
- ðŸ“« If you need to reach me you can message me here.
